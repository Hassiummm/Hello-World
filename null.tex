In higher-level mathematics, such as algebra, students need ``mathematical maturity'' to understand and apply abstract ideas. There is no obvious way to determine this maturity, nor a clear method to teach someone how to write a proof. This note is designed to serve as a transition to proof-based mathematics, guiding students in adapting to the way mathematics operates.
\section{Logic}
Logic is the formal framework and rules of inference that ensure the validity and coherence of arguments in mathematics. We shall accept that sentences can be either true or wrong.
