I'm glad you read this first ^ _ ^ 

About my LaTeX style: it is now a .tex document, you can use \input to include it. This is a simple scheme, add anything you want to upgrade it! (or remove some commands you don't like) ╭(╯^╰)╮

About my repositories: all repositories are notes for books and articles (◐‿◑)

Here's a detailed plan:

Textbooks: not sure yet (´･_･`)

Here's my plan! 

  #1 Textooks
  
  Not sure yet (´･_･`)

  Textbooks should be really good books that are dense and thoughtful. Usually, I will do all the odd-number exercises. 
  
  plan: lots of books to do (maybe I have to choose one for now), the most possible book is Algebra by Lang, which is my favorite book in algebra.
  
  #2 Reference Books

  Please recommend any books or articles you think are interesting (>^ω^<)
