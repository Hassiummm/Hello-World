I'm glad you read this first ^ _ ^ 

Contents: notes/articles for everything I'm interested in (◐‿◑), and notes for classes (￣▽￣)

I made several lists for all of the repositories. New lists will be added if needed.

Here's my plan! 

  #1 Textooks
  
  Not sure yet (´･_･`)

  Textbooks should be really good books that are dense and thoughtful. Some of the exercises will be selected and given with my proofs.
  
  plan: lots of books to do (maybe I have to choose one for now), the most possible book is Algebra by Lang, which is my favorite book in algebra.
  
  #2 Lecture Notes

  MATH 500: Abstract Algebra I 

  Each lecture note corresponds to a class (think of a bijection between sets). Those notes are always dense and well-structured. I have no plan about those notes since it does not depend on me...
  
  #3 Reference Books

  Not sure yet (´･_･`)

If you want proofs for all exercises, click [here](https://www.theproofistrivial.com/) for inspiration. (⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)

I do have a simple style document, named hassium.sty, that I use in every note. You can check that and update it to make it look nicer. 

Please recommend any books or articles you think are interesting (>^ω^<)
