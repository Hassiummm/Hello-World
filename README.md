I'm glad you read this first ^ _ ^ 

About my LaTeX style: it is now a .tex document, you can use \input to include it. 

This is a simple scheme, add anything you want to upgrade it! (or remove some commands you don't like) ╭(╯^╰)╮

About my repositories: all repositories are notes for books and articles 

In my opnion, textbooks should be really good books that are dense and thoughtful, and I plan to include the best textbooks I've read. Usually, I choose to do all the odd-number exercises (so you do at least one-half of the exercises, this is a simple proof right?)

More details or plans? Not sure yet (´･_･`)

Please recommend any books or articles you think are interesting (>^ω^<) 

If you find mistakes in my notes, please contact me: andyshuaihao@gmail.com
