# About my LaTeX style #

It's now a .tex document, so you can include it using \input. This is a simple setup—feel free to remove any commands you find unnecessary. ╭(╯^╰)╮

I made a small demo for this, check what it looks like!

I plan to add more functions to this style. Please contact me if you have any idea.

# About my repositories #

All repositories are notes for books and articles. I believe textbooks should be dense, thoughtful, and genuinely insightful. My goal is to include only the best textbooks I've read. Typically, I work on all odd-numbered exercises, which covers at least half of all questions. (A simple proof left to the reader; take a second to think about it.)

<h3>Any plans or more details?</h3>

I'm writing notes for:

1. *Algebraic Geometry* by R. Hartshorne
2. *Introduction to Homological Algebra* by C. Weibel

You can check the repository to see the current status of my notes. lots work to do... (´･_･`)

<h3>Completed</h3>

This will be the place that I list all completed repositories, but for now, nothing is in here.

<h3>Some Remarks</h3>

Every math repository assumes that readers are familiar with proof-based mathematics.

It is always better to read books and do some practices by yourself. Notes are just companion materials, they are not textbooks.

Please take more time to think harder when you find something difficult.

Enjoy your life!
