# About my LaTeX style #

It's now a .tex document, so you can include it using \input. This is a simple setup—feel free to suggest improvements or remove any commands you find unnecessary. ╭(╯^╰)╮

I made a small demo for this, so called a style, check what it looks like!

# About my repositories #

All repositories are notes for books and articles. I believe textbooks should be dense, thoughtful, and genuinely insightful. My goal is to include only the best textbooks I've read. Typically, I work on all odd-numbered exercises, which covers at least half of all questions. (A simple proof left to the reader; take a second to think about it.)

<h3>Any plans or more details?</h3>

I'm writing notes for:

1. *Algebraic Geometry* by R. Hartshorne
2. *Introduction to Homological Algebra* by C. Weibel

You can check the repository to see the current status of my notes. lots work to do... (´･_･`)

<h3>Completed</h3>

This will be the place that I list all completed repositories, but for now, nothing is in here.

Please share any books or articles you find interesting (>^ω^<)
