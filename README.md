It is now a .tex document, you can use \input to include it. This is a simple scheme, add anything you want to upgrade it! 
How it looks? I will publish a repository soon~

Here's my plan! 

  #1 Textooks
  
  Not sure yet (´･_･`)

  Textbooks should be really good books that are dense and thoughtful. Usually, I will do all the odd-number exercises. 
  
  plan: lots of books to do (maybe I have to choose one for now), the most possible book is Algebra by Lang, which is my favorite book in algebra.
  
  #2 Reference Books

  Not sure yet (´･_･`)

If you want proofs for all exercises, click [here](https://www.theproofistrivial.com/) for inspiration. (⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)

I do have a simple style document, named hassium.sty, that I use in every note. You can check that and update it to make it look nicer. 

Please recommend any books or articles you think are interesting (>^ω^<)
