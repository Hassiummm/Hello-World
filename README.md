I'm glad you read this first ^ _ ^ 

<h3>About my LaTeX style</h3>

It's now a .tex document, so you can include it using \input. This is a simple setup—feel free to suggest improvements or remove any commands you find unnecessary. ╭(╯^╰)╮

<h3>About my repositories</h3>

All repositories are notes for books and articles. I believe textbooks should be dense, thoughtful, and genuinely insightful. My goal is to include only the best textbooks I've read. Typically, I work on all odd-numbered exercises, which covers at least half of all questions. (A simple proof left to the reader; take a second to think about it.)

Any plans or more details? Not certain yet. (´･_･`)

Please share any books or articles you find interesting (>^ω^<)
