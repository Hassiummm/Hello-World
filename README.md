# About my LaTeX template #

It's now a .tex document, so you can include it using \input. This is a simple setup—feel free to remove any commands you find unnecessary. ╭(╯^╰)╮

I made a small demo for this, check what it looks like! If you are interested in how it looks for a math note, check any of my note. All my notes are using the same template.

I plan to add more functions to this style. Please contact me if you have any idea.

# About my repositories #

All repositories are notes for books and articles. Typically, I try all odd-numbered exercises, which covers at least half of all questions. (A simple proof left to the reader; take a second to think about it.)

<h3>Any plans or more details?</h3>

I'm writing notes for:

????

You can check the repository to see the current status of my notes. 

I'm working on a little project with my friends: *An Introduction to Proofs*

This is a short (not short anymore) note that designed to be a transition to proof-based mathematics, including some basic concepts in sets, functions... If you want to start with mathematics, it might be a good option. 

lots work to do... (´･_･`)

<h3>Completed</h3>

This will be the place that I list all completed repositories, but for now, nothing is in here. Hopefully there will be something someday. idk ╭(╯^╰)╮

# Some Remarks # 

It is always better to read books and practice independently. Notes are merely companion materials; they are not textbooks.

When you encounter something difficult, take more time to think deeply.

Enjoy your life!
